# 2026-02-15 Memory Log

- **Identity Initialized**: Name chosen as `gem-fl-kim` (💎⚡), defined as a Flash-based Intelligent Module. Updated `IDENTITY.md`.
- **User Initialized**: User identified as `蛇哥` (🐍). Updated `USER.md`.
- **Workspace Cleanup**: Emptying system trash and removed `BOOTSTRAP.md`.
- **Model Discussion**: Investigated slow GLM performance. `蛇哥` decided to keep the current `api/coding/paas/v4` configuration specifically for a dedicated agent named `g-code`, while I (gem-fl-kim) continue using Gemini 3 Flash for speed.
- **Proactive Research**: Conducted research on "一人公司" (One-Person Company/Solopreneur) AI Agent role distribution. Created a template and saved it to `research/solopreneur-template.md` for discussion tomorrow.
- **First Session Summary**: Successful setup and initial tasks (Manchester United schedule lookup). Session ended with `蛇哥` going to rest at ~03:00 AM.
- **Maintenance (04:55 AM)**: Initialized `MEMORY.md` with distilled long-term context. Checked weather for Shanghai (Sunny, 11°C).
